# PiScore
The PiScore Project

A system for playing back video scores and keeping in sync across multiple devices.

Raspberry Pi 3 and Processing.

Currently an ugly prototype with hard coded paths etc. USE WITH CAUTION!!!

Launcher currently broken.
To launch client: sketch_Server must be modified: clientp = true;
then launch as server... Must fix.
